## About The Project

6 questions are covered to extracting and visualizing finance stock data via plotly dashboard. The dashboard was active in that time range in that port but right now we can not visualize the graphs because that port is not active anymore. That's why I uploaded the question's screenshots, you can see the results from there.

## Technologies-Libraries

Python with Pandas, yfinance, BeautifulSoup, Plotly
